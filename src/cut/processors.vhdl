    -- Internal Component Processor #5 â€” Reset Password on Storage Mechanism (Has Interrupts)
    -- Password Resetter.
    -- Description    : Resets Password by Filling Patterns with Claps Per Second.

    -- Notes:
    --  1. This process can be run if only if there's a # of CLAP_MIN_LEN_PW or CLAP_MAX_LEN_PW bits opened.
    --  2. This process is very similar in Process 1, except that it acknowledges the button inputs after iteration immediately.
    --  3. This function also doesn't care about your Microphone turned on (along with LED) because it has nothing to do with it.
    --  4. This process doesn't rely on other processors to check the password. It's best to check it inside the processor instead.
